I'm a second-year computer science Ph.D. student in the [DataLab](https://ics.uci.edu/~smyth/research_group.html) group at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Dr. Padhraic Smyth](https://ics.uci.edu/~smyth/index.html). 
I am broadly interested in understanding human-AI interaction, focusing on developing methods and tools based on Bayesian learning and cognitive science. My current research focuses on developing online adaptive AI systems to infer human abilities and provide tailored suggestions.  I’m a member of the [HPI Research Center in Machine Learning and Data Science](https://hpi.ics.uci.edu/students/) at UCI.

Prior to joining UC Irvine, I earned dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Psychology from UC Davis. I was a research assistant with [Dr. Jeffrey Schank](https://agent-based-models.com/schanklab/research/) and with [Dr. Huaijun Zhou](https://zhou.faculty.ucdavis.edu/).
