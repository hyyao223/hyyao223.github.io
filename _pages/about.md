I am a third-year PhD candidate in the Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Strategic Management (TIES) group at the MIT Sloan School of Management. My research focuses on the economics of science and innovation, with an emphasis on international knowledge diffusion.

Prior to joining MIT, I received my bachelor’s degree in Economics from UC Berkeley and worked as a predoctoral research assistant with Prof. Abhishek Nagaraj.
